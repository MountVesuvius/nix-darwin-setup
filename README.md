**Notes:**

Remember you need to install Rosetta
`softwareupdate --install-rosetta`

I have symlinked `.config` to `/etc/nix-darwin/` so i can run `sudo darwin-rebuild switch` easily
without hassle. also has removed some editing roadblocks of having to sudo everything

**todo:**
need to clean up nvim dotfiles, it's really really all over the place. i've taken too much stuff
from a bunch of old dotfiles of mine and random snippets online.
